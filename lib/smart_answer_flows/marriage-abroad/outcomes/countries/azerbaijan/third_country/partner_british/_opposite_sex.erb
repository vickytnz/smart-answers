Contact the relevant local authorities in Azerbaijan to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Azerbaijan](/foreign-travel-advice/azerbaijan) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/azerbaijan/uk/partner_british/opposite_sex)
- [go to Azerbaijan and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/azerbaijan/ceremony_country/partner_british/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice, you’ll normally have to wait at least 13 days for your CNI. It can take longer depending on the local authorities’ processes and the time of year.%
