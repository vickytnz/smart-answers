Check your State Pension age

Your State Pension age is the earliest age you can start receiving your State Pension. It may be different to the age you can get a [workplace or personal pension](/early-retirement-pension/personal-and-workplace-pensions).  

Your State Pension age is worked out based on your gender and date of birth. 

You can [keep working after you reach State Pension age](/working-retirement-pension-age). ‘Default retirement age’ (a forced retirement age of 65) no longer exists.

^[The State Pension age is under review](/government/news/proposed-new-timetable-for-state-pension-age-increases) and may change in the future.^
