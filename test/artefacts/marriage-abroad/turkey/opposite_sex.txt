Marriage in Turkey

## Before you start

Contact the local municipality registry office (‘evlendirme memurluğu’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

## Prove you’re free to get married

You need to swear an affirmation that says you’re legally allowed to get married. It’s valid for 6 months.

An affidavit is a religious document. If you don’t want to swear a religious oath, you can sign an affirmation instead.

^Your partner will also need to swear an affirmation if they’re British. If they’re not British or Turkish, they’ll still need to prove they can get married.^

s1. Download an [affirmation](/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/322630/Turkey_Marriage_Form_24June14.pdf).
s2. Print it out but don’t sign it.
s3. Make an appointment to sign it - where you do this depends on where you are.

^Affirmations must be filled in using black ink only.^

### If you’re in the UK

Make an appointment with a [UK notary or commissioner of oaths](http://www.thenotariessociety.org.uk/find-a-notary) to swear your affirmation. They’ll charge you a fee.

You’ll need to get your affirmation [‘legalised’](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) before you travel to Turkey.

### If you’re in Turkey

Make an appointment to swear your affirmation at:

- [the British Consulate General in Istanbul](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-consulate-general-istanbul/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)
- [the embassy in Ankara](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-ankara/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)
- [the consulate in Izmir](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-consulate-izmir/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)
- [the consulate in Antalya](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-vice-consulate-antalya/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker)

It costs £50 per person to swear an affirmation. You can pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/turkey-consular-fees) in cash or with a credit card or UK debit card.

You’ll need to get your affirmation ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by the local authorities. The embassy or consulate will help you with this.

### What you need to bring to your appointment

You need to bring:

- your passport
- your affirmation
- proof of your address, for example a utility bill or driving licence
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- your [original decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time of the divorce.^

If your documents aren’t in English or Turkish, you’ll need to bring [certified translations](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) as well as the originals.

## Get married

Take your signed legalised affirmation to the marriage office nearest to where you live or are staying. They’ll tell you how to apply to get married and book your ceremony.

If you want to get married in a different district, the marriage officer will give you a permit (‘izin belgesi’). They might charge a fee for this. 

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Turkey
- it would be allowed under UK law

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
